We are given a dataset about past loans of old customers such as Due date,education,age,gender,loan amount,paid status etc. is given.
With that, we need to predict whether a new customer will pay off a loan or not.
The model is built using 4 algorithms:
1)KNN
2)SVM
3)Logistic regression
4)Decision Tree
and the accuracy of each algorithms is reported so that the best classifier can be found out.
